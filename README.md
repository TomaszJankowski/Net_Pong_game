# Net_pong_game
Started as project for University class but I still work on it in spare time.
// = Fixed

One of my first games as well as my first attemtp to make multiplayer game.

Did not change Network Manager settings because of that mulitplayer only works on the same machine.
//Add main menu. //Ball sometimes starts directly up or down. // Make local multiplayer. Make singleplayer mode.
Score text doesn't align with middle.// Change naming of scenes to be more clear. Add little particle effect when scoring.
Fix the ball so it waits for second player. Change setting so game works through LAN.


Added Local Multi, Pause Menu, Changed multi a bit but is still broken.
